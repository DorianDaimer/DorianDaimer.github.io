excerpt: 'We use the framework of partially observable information engines to obtain an analytical characterization of thermodynamically rational agent behaviour for a simple, yet non--trivial example of a Maxwell's demon operating under uncertainty. Our results provide the first complete detailed physical understanding of a decision problem under uncertainty.

We use the framework of partially observable information engines to obtain an analytical characterization of thermodynamically rational agent behaviour for a simple, yet non--trivial example of a "Maxwell's demon" operating under uncertainty. Our results provide the first complete detailed physical understanding of a decision problem under uncertainty.
