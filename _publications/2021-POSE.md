excerpt: 'This papers provides the first example of a Partially Observable Szilard Engine. The partially observable engine is obtained from a standard Szilard Engine by inserting the divider at an angle instead of horizontally. The resulting family of engines (parameterized by the angle) is analyzed in great detail within the framework of Generalized Partially Observable Information Engines.'

This papers provides the first example of a Partially Observable Szilard Engine and thus exemplifies an important generalization of standard information engines. The partially observable engine is obtained from a standard Szilard Engine by inserting the divider at an angle instead of horizontally. The resulting family of engines (parameterized by the angle) is analyzed in great detail within the framework of Generalized Partially Observable Information Engines.
