permalink: /publications/2022-04-28-POSE
excerpt: 'This papers provides the first example of a Partially Observable Szilard Engine. The partially observable engine is obtained from a standard Szilard Engine by inserting the divider at an angle instead of horizontally. The resulting family of engines (parameterized by the angle) is analyzed in great detail within the framework of Generalized Partially Observable Information Engines. Interestingly, optimal data encodings for the partially observable engines are probabilistic in general and we provide a scheme to construct these probabilistic data representations in a simple way.

This papers provides the first example of a Partially Observable Szilard Engine. The partially observable engine is obtained from a standard Szilard Engine by inserting the divider at an angle instead of horizontally. The resulting family of engines (parameterized by the angle) is analyzed in great detail within the framework of Generalized Partially Observable Information Engines. Interestingly, optimal data encodings for the partially observable engines are probabilistic in general and we provide a scheme to construct these probabilistic data representations in a simple way.
