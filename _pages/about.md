Research Interests

I am a theoretical physicist and cognitive scientist by training. My research interests revolve around the intersection of these two disciplines. More specifically, I am interested in physical limits of information processing in biological as well as artificial systems and in the theoretical descriptions of learning systems. To investigate these questions, I am using concepts from information theory and non-equilibrium thermodynamics (both classical and quantum) to develop a better understanding of the systems in question and their fundamental limitations. Currently I am studying generalizations of Information Engines to a setting where the observer only has access to partial information about the engine. This scenario is ubiquitous in real-world systems and contains rich and unintuitive physics. While my focus lies on the theoretical description of such systems, there are many possible applications, such as the development of efficient learning algorithms and optimized information processing engines
Furthermore I am working on extending a general formalism for treating costs and benefits of memories developed by [Dr. Susanne Still] (https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.124.050601) from the classical regime to quantum systems.
