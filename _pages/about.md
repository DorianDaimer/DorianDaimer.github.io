Research Interests

I am a theoretical physicist and cognitive scientist by training. My research interests revolve around the intersection of these two disciplines. More specifically, I am interested in physical limits of information processing in biological as well as artificial systems and in physical theories of consciousness. To investigate these questions, I am using concepts from information theory and non-equilibrium thermodynamics to develop a better understanding of learning systems. During my PhD I will try to expand this fruitful approach to quantum systems. While my focus lies on the theoretical description of these systems, there are many possible applications of the theoretical results, such as the development of efficient learning algorithms and optimized information processing engines.
