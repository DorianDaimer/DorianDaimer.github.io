Research Interests

I am a theoretical physicist and cognitive scientist by training. My research interests revolve around the intersection of these two disciplines. More specifically, I am interested in physical limits of information processing in biological as well as artificial systems and in the theoretical descriptions of learning systems. To investigate these questions, I am using concepts from information theory and non-equilibrium thermodynamics to develop a better understanding of the systems in question. During my PhD I aim to expand existing theories and results derived by others such as [Dr. Susanne Still](http://www2.hawaii.edu/%7Esstill/index.html) from the analysis of classical systems to the quantum regime. While my focus lies on the theoretical description of these systems, there are many possible applications, such as the development of efficient learning algorithms and optimized information processing engines.
